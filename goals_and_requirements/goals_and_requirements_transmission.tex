\section{Transmission and drivetrain}

For successful clutch operations, \citet{clutch_control} quantify two requirements to be satisfied by any clutch controller:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a \emph{no-kill} condition, whereby the engine speed must remain above a certain value, $\omega_e^{min}$, and
  \item a \emph{no-lurch} condition which states that the derivative of the clutch slip $\dot{\omega}_{s1}=\dot{\omega}_e-\dot{\omega}_c$ at the moment of full engagement is near zero. This means the car doesn't jerk or lurch forward, and is a more important requirement when crawling than launching.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Shift Speed}

Improve shift speed and smoothness, 50 ms to upshift, 100 ms to downshift.


\subsection{Launch Control}

Provide launch control, decrease launch time and wheel slippage by
xxx.


\subsection{Neutral Find}

Decrease time required to find neutral, worst case is 500 ms.


\subsection{Anti-Stall}

Implement anti-stall feature, avoid stalling in any gear in spin-out
situations etc.


\subsection{Electropneumatics}

Reduce air consumption by 50\%, improve reliability.
