\chapter{System Design\label{cha:design}}

As mentioned in Sec. \ref{sec:intro_strategy}, the overall target of this project is to develop four electronic modules and an electro-pneumatic actuation system for the 2010 Formula SAE vehicle. This chapter describes the design of these modules and the electro-pneumatic system, and provides context for design choices. The electrical portions of the design will be discussed in more detail than the mechanical portions, as the main focus of the thesis is electrical. 

Figure \ref{fig:design_overview} shows the electrical and mechanical interrelations between the modules and the systems they interact. All of the modules communicate over a shared network, which reduces the amount of point-to-point wiring required.
