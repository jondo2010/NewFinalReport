\section{Engine and Transmission Module}

The engine and transmission module is designed to meet the engine and transmission goals outlined in Secs. \ref{sec:goals_engine} and \ref{goals_transmission}, namely to provide optimized selection of the variable-length intake, to change gears at the driver's request without requiring manual clutching, and to implement transmission features that make driving easier. 

\subsection{Overview}

Figure \ref{fig:design_engine_overview} shows an overview of the engine and transmission controller and it's interactions with the environment.

Provide intelligent control of the intake runner length and transmission system.
Provide the control signals required to actuate the clutch and gear position levers with the pneumatic system.

\subsection{Processes}

The major processes of the engine and transmission module, \emph{upshift}, \emph{downshift}, and \emph{neutral find}, are described at a high level using flow charts.

\subsubsection{Upshift}

When the Transmission Manager receives an upshift request over the network, it creates asynchronous events in the Event Scheduler to respond to the request, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:transmission_upshift_flow}. The upshift process depends upon feedback from the ECU of engine RPM and gear position. Shift cut is enabled on the ECU to drop the engine RPM by a slight amount $RPM^{TH}_{cut}$ (the exact amount is a tuned parameter.) When the RPM has dropped, the upshift solenoid is engaged, actuating the pneumatics to push the shift lever. When the module receives notification that the current gear has incremented, the pneumatics are relaxed, and shift cut is disabled.

\nomenclature{$RPM^{TH}_{cut}$}{The threshold RPM is expected to drop when shiftcut is enabled for no-lift upshifting.}

\begin{figure}[H]

\input{design/figures/transmission_upshift_flow}
\caption{Transmission upshift procedure.}
\label{fig:transmission_upshift_flow}
\end{figure}

The asynchronous wait operations that depend on external feedback all have built-in timeout mechanisms that prevent deadlock in the event of a problem in the actuation or feedback path.

\subsubsection{Downshift}

When the Transmission Manager receives a downshift request over the network, similar to the upshift request handling, it creates asynchronous events in the Event Scheduler to respond to the request. Figure \ref{fig:transmission_downshift_flow} shows the flow chart of the downshift procedure. Clutch engagement and disengagement is handled asynchronously by the Clutch Controller. The downshift procedure differs from the upshift procedure in that the downshift requires use of the clutch, as well as two asynchronous incoming events from the driver:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The original downshift request, when the driver pulls and holds the downshift paddle on the steering wheel, and
  \item a clutch engagement request, issued when the driver releases the downshift paddle.
\end{enumerate}

Adding this extra clutch engagement request allows the driver to delay re-engagement of the clutch so that they can blip the throttle to avoid engine compression and the possibility of a spinout when the clutch plates re-engage (this was explained in Sec. \ref{sec:background_transmission}.)

Additionally, a minimum clutch disengagement time $t^{clutch}_{min}$ is observed (another tunable parameter) in the event the driver pulls the paddle and releases it without any delay.

\subsubsection{Advanced Transmission Features}

\begin{description}

\item[Auto Upshift Feature]

This feature of the engine module is aimed primarily at improving performance in the acceleration event. Based on known torque curves, a table of optimal shift points in the RPM range is developed. As the engine reaches the top RPM for a given gear, the engine module will automatically upshift to the next gear, without any driver input. All the driver needs to do is maintain full throttle, and hold on.

\item[Launch]
Full-throttle launch uses an important feature of the ECU called launch control. From a stand-still, the slip ratio of the driven wheels to the non-driven wheels is monitored, and the engine output power is reduced until the ratio reaches 1:1. Drivers use this feature by maintaining full-throttle at the starting line while holding the brake pedal. As soon as the brake pedal is released, the the engine module will release the clutch in a controlled manner in an attempt to get the best possible acceleration.

\item[Crawl]
Part-throttle launch is a feature designed to mimic an automatic transmission. By controlling the clutch position, and thereby modulating the amount of torque transferred to the wheels for a short period of time, the car can be made to creep slowly from a standstill. This will be used when driving up to the starting line of various dynamic events.

\item[Neutral Find]
As drivers come in to the pits from driving the course, a useful feature is the ability for the car to shift the transmission back into neutral to avoid stalling the car. The neutral find feature will automatically downshift the transmission repeatedly until it finds neutral.

\subsubsection{I/O lines to the ECU}

The engine and transmission module has a several CMOS-level outputs to discrete control pins on the ECU:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A line to the launch control pin, which when toggled enables and disables the launch control feature,
  \item A line to the shift cut pin, which when held high enables shift cut, decreasing engine power to allow for an upshift,
  \item A line to the traction cut percent pin, which is a \unit{0-5}{\volt} level signalled input changing the amount of acceptable wheel slip before traction control cuts in.
  \item A line to the traction control on/off pin, which toggles the traction control feature,
  \item A line to the traction control wet/dry pin, which swaps between two traction control presets.
\end{itemize}

The outputs of these lines are controlled in the system software through the event scheduler.
