\chapter{Results and Discussion}

The Engine and Transmission, and Braking modules both require that the Formula SAE 2010 vehicle be at least partly complete for testing. Since the build schedule for the vehicle is to have it complete for the beginning of May, 2010, much of the testing and tuning of these modules is incomplete.

The electronics for all four modules is completely implemented, tested and debugged. Most of the system software for all four modules has also been written.

\subsection{LCD Interface}

The memory-mapped LCD module interface, as described in \ref{sec:lcd_module_data_interface}, proved to be very useful in implementing the user interface software. By using GDB connected to the running Driver Interface module, it was possible to read and write data directly to the LCD by issuing GDB memory access commands. Several GDB macro scripts were set up

\subsubsection{Bench Experiments}

To verify the LCD data interface circuitry before the final Driver Interface module hardware had been completed, a bench test of the LCD module with an ARM7 development board was conducted. The bus interface as designed in Sec.\ \ref{sec:lcd_module_data_interface} was implemented on a breadboard: a latch and level shifter were used as in the Driver Interface module circuit design, and an FPC cable adapter was constructed with the aide of the tech shop to allow connecting the LCD module to the breadboard. The GPIO pins on the ARM7 development board (shown in red in Fig.\ \ref{fig:can_bench_test}) were used to bit-bang the data interface to the LCD. This test setup was used to write the initial LCD module code used in the final Driver Interface module implementation.

Once all the hardware bugs with the Driver Interface module had been corrected, it was possible to continue writing the LCD interfacing software that had been started during the initial LCD testing. The external memory interface circuitry described in Sec.\ \label{sec:lcd_module_data_interface} worked without issue. Figure \ref{fig:driver_interface_lcd} shows the LCD displaying a sample bitmap from the manufacturer.
