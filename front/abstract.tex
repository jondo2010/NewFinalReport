  Statement of the problem
• Procedures and methods used
• Results
• Conclusions

The problem is tackled with a distributed divide and conquer approach: and architecture of four seperate electronic modules is devised. Each module is designed to communicate with the others as well as pre-existing modules.

Four prototype modules were constructed with custom-designed printed circuit boards.

Final testing of the engine and transmission module, and the braking module was not conducted since the completed SAE vehicle intended for installation was not yet available.
