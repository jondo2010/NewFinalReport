\section{Telemetry}

The main goal of the telemetry system is to provide a reliable wireless connection between the two data-gathering devices on the vehicle (the ECU and DAC) and their respective software packages running on a pit crew laptop some distance away from the vehicle. Requirements for these goals are elaborated on in the following sections.

\subsection{Engine Control Unit (ECU)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Provide a wireless bi-directional serial link between the ECU software and module.
\item The link must operate at 57.6 KBps, 8 data bits, no parity bit, and 1 stop bit.
\item The link must be completely transparent to the software.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Acquisition Unit (DAC)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Provide a wireless uni-directional serial link between the DAC software and module.
\item The link must operate at 38.4 KBps, 8 data bits, no parity bit, and 1 stop bit.
\item The link must be completely transparent to the software.
\item Provide a means of injecting secondary data into the DAC stream, such as engine RPM and other parameters, for monitoring by the DAC software.
\item Provide a means of decoding the DAC stream on the vehicle itself to display information to the driver.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Wireless Data Link}

\begin{itemize}

\item Be able to interface with two laptops with a range of at least one kilometre.
\item Provide on-the-fly resolution of interference conflicts with other teams running similar wireless systems.
\item Indicate wireless signal strength to the driver and pit crew as a percentage with resolution of 1\% of maximum signal
strength. 
\end{itemize}
