\chapter{Goals and Requirements\label{cha:goals}}

The guiding principle for the project is to incorporate changes that will improve the team's standing at competition. This can be achieved by improving the vehicle's performance, and by reducing the demand on the driver so that they may focus more on driving the vehicle. This chapter outlines the goals and requirements to which our design is built and measured against.

Each of the five major systems introduced in Ch. \ref{cha:background} have a set of goals and requirements associated with them. The limitations and shortcomings of each system that were encountered in previous years will be addressed. When possible, quantitative targets will be set based on research and recommendations from the mechanical engineers involved with the vehicle.
