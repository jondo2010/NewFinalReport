\chapter{System Design\label{ch:design}}

The overall end goal of this project is to develop 4 electronic modules for the 2010 Formula SAE vehicle, as described before. The discussion of design in this chapter will also include information about the larger systems that each module is a part of in order to provide context. The mechanical portions of the design will be discussed in less detail than the electrical systems, since this is the focus of this thesis.
