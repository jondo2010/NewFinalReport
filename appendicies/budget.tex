\chapter{Budget}

Costs incurred in this project were all hardware related, since all software used was free and open-source. The custom printed circuit boards made up the majority of the cost, followed by the LCD modules, and then the individual components. The cost of the PCB manufacture and LCD modules was donated to the Formula SAE team by the companies involved. Table \ref{tab:budget} below outlines the total costs of hardware obtained for the project.
