\section{Hardware Implementation\label{sec:Hardware-Implementation}}


\subsection{Methodology}

Commonality between modules, same life-support system.


\subsection{CAD Design}

Schematic capture and PCB layout using EagleCAD.


\subsection{Commonalities}

All 4 modules are implemented on custom printed circuit boards (PCBs) with an \emph{AT90CAN128} micro-controller from Atmel. Programming and debugging software on the microcontroller was done through a standard IEEE 1149.1 JTAG interface. The module is linked to the other system modules with a CAN bus. All inter-module communication is done over the CAN bus.
