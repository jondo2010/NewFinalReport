\section{Braking Module Design\label{sec:Braking-Module-Design}}


\subsection{Purpose}

Adjust the brake bias position electronically and on-demand from the
driver.

Provide calibration sequences to allow for mechanical wear.


\subsection{Processes}


\subsubsection{Brake Bias Calibration}


\subsubsection{Brake Bias Adjustment}


\subsubsection{Pressure Sensor Calibration}


\subsection{Software}

Software overview diagram


\subsubsection{Bias Manager}

Handles requests to adjust the brake bias from the network. 

Performs balance bar calibration sequence on demand.


\subsubsection{Pressure Manager}

Continuously samples brake pressure.

Performs a pressure calibration sequence on demand.


\subsubsection{CAN Interface}

As documented above.


\subsubsection{Main Control Loop}

Initializes the system and brings into a known state.

Monitor for system faults and react accordingly.


\subsection{Hardware}


\subsubsection{Microcontroller}

As mentioned above.


\subsubsection{CAN transceiver}

As mentioned above.


\subsubsection{Stepper Motor Driver}

Generates signals required to actuate the stepper motor used to adjust
the balance bar.


\subsubsection{Analogue-to-Digital Converter}

Samples both front and rear pressure sensors. Capable of 10-bit resolution.


\subsubsection{End-of-Travel Sensing Switches}
