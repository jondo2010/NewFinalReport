\chapter{Conclusions and Recommendations}

This chapter will outline the contributions made by the project, and summarise what was accomplished. Recommendations for future work for each of the four modules will also be made.

\section{Contributions}

In this thesis we have discussed the goals, designs, and implementations of a network of four modules for the 2010 Formula SAE vehicle.

\begin{itemize}
  \item A novel pneumatic design was proposed to improve the actuation of the clutch and shift mechanisms of the transmission. A Simulink model was developed of this system, and the hardware and software basis for an on-car controller was designed and implemented. Additionally, driver interactions with the system have been detailed, and advanced controller functions designed.

  \item The first iteration of a braking module was designed and implemented allowing electronic control of the vehicles brake bias.

  \item A multiplexing telemetry module was designed and implemented allowing multiple data source on the vehicle to stream data to their proprietary PC software.

  \item The first iteration of a dynamic driver interface module was designed and implemented that allows drivers to control vehicle parameters at runtime.
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}

To further the goals set out in Ch.\ \ref{cha:goals}, and to generally improve upon what was accomplished during this project, the following items have been identified as reccommendations for future work:

\subsection{Engine and Transmission}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Further testing and integration of the Engine and Transmission module once the 2010 Formula SAE vehicle has been fully constructed.
  \item Complete implementation of the electro-pneumatic actuation system, and connection with the Engine and Transmission module.
  \item Complete implementation of the variable intake actuator, and connection with the Engine and Transmission module.
  \item Take the Simulink model further by identifying the model parameters with the real electro-pneumatic system.
  \item Tune the intake and clutch system controllers. The improved electro-pneumatic model could play a vital role in improving the clutch system controller.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Braking}

\subsection{Telemetry}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Test the range of the telemetry module and its resiliance to noise at the Formula SAE competitions.
  \item Investigate why the DAC decoder is dropping data.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Driver Interface}

Completion of dashboard
completion of bitmap loading (run-lenght-encoding)
