\section{Driver Interface Module\label{sec:Driver-Interface-Module}}
\nomenclature{LCD}{Liquid Crystal Display}

In previous years, the team has often been hindered by a lack of direct information from the electronic systems in the car. The driver interface module remedies this by providing information to the driver in real-time, and allows the driver to control aspects of the electronic control systems. The driver module and it's interactions are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:design_interface_overview_block}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

The driver module receives driver input from \emph{driver controls}, which are tactile inputs for adjusting vehicle dynamics. Driver commands are collected through the controls and relayed across the network to the relevant modules. The module communicates with the driver using the \emph{information display panel}, which displays vehicle information on an easy-to-read display mounted in the steering wheel. Diagnostic information from the other modules is received over the network and relayed to the driver through the information display panel. 

\subsection{Vehicle Dynamics Mode (VDM)}
\nomenclature{VDM}{Vehicle Dynamics Mode}

The driver interface system provides a method of quickly modifying several dynamic vehicle parameters quickly and easily. We have called this feature \emph{vehicle dynamics mode} (VDM). 

For example, an acceleration event calls for launch control, auto-upshift, and a heavy forward brake bias. It is possible to enable all of these features in one step by changing the VDM mode to {}``acceleration''. 

When a new mode is selected, all nodes on the network are notified and synchronized to modify their dynamic parameters in accordance with the specific mode. For example, when the  {}``acceleration'' mode is enabled, the engine module will enable launch control and auto-upshift, and the brake controller will modify the brake bias to a pre-set ratio.

\begin{description}
  \item [{Pit Mode}] enables soft-launch driving characteristics that mimic a fully automatic transmission. This makes slowly driving the car forward from a stand-still far easier, and only requires the driver to take their left foot off the brake, and slightly apply the throttle.
  \item [{Acceleration Mode}] puts the vehicle systems into full-performance characteristics. Launch control is activated. The engine module will watch for a launch signal from the driver, and will automatically up-shift based on the engine RPM.
  \item [{Dynamic Mode}] puts the vehicle systems into a mode that is suitable for the autocross, and the endurance race.
\end{description}

Individual VDM parameters can be changed by the driver using the driver controls. Existing presets may be overwritten on demand with the new parameters chosen by the driver.

\subsection{Driver Controls}
\label{sec:interface_controls}

The driver controls consist of adjustment knobs, buttons, and paddle shifters. See table \ref{table:driver_controls} for a description of each.

\begin{table}[H]

\subsection{Diagnostic Information}
\label{sec:interface_diag}

The interface display panel is a large monochrome \emph{Liquid Crystal Display} (LCD) screen, inset in the steering wheel. The panel provides real-time information to the driver regarding all of the electronic systems in the car. Primary information displayed on the panel includes:

\begin{itemize}
\item the selected gear;
\item the active vehicle dynamics mode;
\item the telemetry signal strength;
\item the engine RPM;
\item the vehicle wheel speed; and
\item the status of the launch control feature.
\end{itemize}

The list of available options and the current value for the selected option is displayed on screen when the driver rotates the option dial. After a timeout period, normal real-time information display resumes. 

\subsection{Hardware}

A high-level overview of the module's hardware design is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:interface_hardware_design_block}. The driver interface module builds on the common architecture present in the other three modules. 

\begin{figure}[H]

\input{design/figures/interface_hardware_design_block}
\caption{Block diagram of the driver interface module hardware.}
\label{fig:interface_hardware_design_block}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{LCD Module}

The LCD module is a self-contained unit that consists of an easy-to-read LCD screen and a controller for interfacing the LCD with a micro-controller. It is not directly attached to the driver interface module, to help decouple the driver interface module and steering wheel design.

\subsubsection{Knobs, Buttons, and Paddles}

The buttons and paddles described in Sec. \ref{sec:interface_controls} are connected to the driver interface module through wiring to allow placement throughout the steering wheel. Appropriate de-bouncing and encoding circuitry is present to interface the controls with the module. 

\subsection{Software}

A block-diagram overview of the software design is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:interface_software_design_block}. Like with other designs, various managers oversee operation of the module, and interact with hardware through abstraction interfaces.

	\input{design/figures/interface_software_design_block}
	\caption{Block diagram of the driver interface module software.}
	\label{fig:interface_software_design_block}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{User Interface Manager}

The user interface manager controls the content displayed on the information display panel, and implements a menu system for the driver to modify the various dynamic parameters of the vehicle. New input from the driver is directed to the interface for processing. Vehicle diagnostics are also relayed to the manager and displayed as appropriate. The user interface manager updates the information display panel through the LCD interface.

\subsubsection{Diagnostics Manager}

The diagnostics manager listens to the network for the information listed in Sec. \ref{sec:interface_diag}. It grabs important vehicle parameters and coordinates with the user interface manager to display them on the information display panel.

\subsubsection{VDM Manager}

The VDM manager handles requests from the driver control manager to change the current vehicle dynamic mode, and to overwrite the dynamic mode presets. It uses the CAN interface to communicate the new parameters over the network to the other modules. The non-volatile storage interface is utilized to load and save the parameters for each preset. 

\subsubsection{Driver Controls Manager}

The driver controls manager listens for new driver inputs on the knobs, buttons, and paddles. Driver input is directed to the user interface manager for processing. Transmission requests are relayed directly to the engine and transmission module over the CAN interface.

\subsubsection{LCD Interface}

The LCD interface abstracts the functionality of the LCD module for the user interface manager. It translates high-level drawing and text commands into the low-level memory operations required by the LCD module to draw on the screen.

\subsubsection{GPIO Interface}

The GPIO interface monitors the knobs, buttons, and levers for activity. It notifies the driver control manager when a change of state occurs. 

\subsubsection{Non-Volatile Storage Interface}

The non-volatile storage interface reads and writes vehicle dynamic mode parameters to the non-volatile storage portion of the micro-controller. It is used whenever a parameter set is overwritten by the driver, or a new dynamic mode is selected.
