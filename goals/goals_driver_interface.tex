\section{Driver Interface}

The driver interface targets several major goals, such as providing access to critical features with a minimal amount of effort, providing visual feedback of the state of the vehicle without distracting the driver, and allowing the driver and pit crew to adjust the vehicle dynamic parameters as quickly and easily as possible. This is accomplished with the introduction of a driver display, integrated into the steering wheel.

\subsection{Driver Controls}

\begin{itemize}
\item Provide a means of shifting gears without manual timing or clutching.
\item Allow the driver to enable or disable all of the transmission features such as the auto up-shift feature, etc.
\item Provide the driver with a button to start or stop the engine. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Vehicle Dynamic Adjustment}

\begin{itemize}
\item Provide an easy to use interface graphical interface to adjust vehicle dynamic parameters.
\item Allow the driver to choose between sets of dynamic vehicle parameters or `operating modes'.
\item Selecting an operating mode should be accomplished with a single knob.
\item Adjusting vehicle parameters should be disabled above speeds of \unit{25}{\kilo\metre\per\hour}.
\item The driver should be able to tune individual dynamic parameters and overwrite preset operating modes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Diagnostic Information}

\begin{itemize}
\item Critical warnings regarding oil pressure and engine temperature must be delivered to the driver on an easy-to-read display.
\item The current gear and RPM should be displayed prominently on the screen so that they are readable at all times.
\item Supplementary vehicle performance information such as fuel level, oil pressure, and battery voltage should be made available to the driver without being a distraction.
\item The wireless telemetry link status should be displayed at all times.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Visually Appealing Interface}

\begin{itemize}
\item On-screen fonts must be easy-to-read.
\item The display should be readable in full light as well as low light.
\item The display should be readable through sun visor helmet.
\end{itemize}
