\section{Telemetry Module\label{sec:Telemetry-Module-Design}}

The \emph{wireless telemetry system} provides a means for multiplexing these data streams and sending them wirelessly to laptops. The vehicle-side of the telemetry system consists of:

\begin{itemize}
\item the \emph{telemetry module}, which gathers and multiplexes the data; and
\item the \emph{wireless modem}, which transmits data wirelessly to a receiver.
\end{itemize}

The remote-side of the telemetry system consists of an off-the-shelf wireless receiver, which receives the data and makes it available on an RS-232 port.


\subsection{Purpose}

Provide a multiplexed virtual serial link between the ECU and the ECU software, and the DAC and the DAC software. Additionally be able to decode the DAC serial data on the car, and inject additional data channels into the DAC serial stream.
