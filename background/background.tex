\chapter{Background\label{cha:background}}

The 2010 Formula SAE vehicle is essentially made up of five functional systems, namely the \emph{engine}, \emph{transmission}, \emph{braking}, \emph{telemetry}, and \emph{driver interface} systems. The background of these systems is discussed further in this chapter, to provide the reader with the knowledge required to follow the reasoning for our design. The specific vehicle components that interface with the four electronic modules and the electro-pneumatic system are annotated in Fig. \ref{fig:background_overview_topdown}.
