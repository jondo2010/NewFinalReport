\section{Architectural Overview}

The architecture can be divided into 4 distinct systems that communicate over a shared network. These systems are:

\begin{itemize}
\item the \emph{engine} system;
\item the \emph{braking} system;
\item the \emph{wireless telemetry} system; and
\item the \emph{driver interface} system.
\end{itemize}

Located at points closest to the mechanical systems they interact with.

Design systems as modularly as possible to reduce development time.

CAN Bus to reduce the number of point-to-point wiring required and increase noise resiliancy, and interface with the existing ECU system easily.
