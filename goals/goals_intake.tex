\section{Intake}

The main goal of the intake system is to increase the output power available to the drivetrain by providing a variable-length runner as suggested by Groening in \cite{LucasIntake}.

\begin{itemize}

\item Implement a variable-length two-position intake to gain a minimum average power advantage of \unit{xxx}{\newton\metre} of torque.
\item Intake runner length should be chosen automatically by determining the best position to optimize output power.
\item Any automatic runner length adjustment scheme should incorporate hysteresis to avoid unnecessarily wearing the mechanical components involved.
\item Changing intake runner length positions should take no more than \unit{150}{\milli\second}.

\end{itemize}
