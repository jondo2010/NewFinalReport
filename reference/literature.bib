@Article{ valve_models,
	abstract = "PWM (Pulse width modulated) solenoid valves possess the advantages of low cost, high flow rate gain, and simple structure. However, the use of a PWM solenoid valve causes both discontinuity and nonlinearity of the flow rate; this results in difficulties of modeling and of control. This paper presents our work on modelling a pneumatic PWM solenoid valve for engineering applications. Two models are presented. one is the instantaneous mass flow rate model which can be used in the simulation to study the dynamic behavior of pneumatic PWM control systems, another model is the equivalent mass flow rate model which is developed for facilitating the synthesis of pneumatic PWM servomechanisms. An equation for determining the maximum operating modulation ratio of the PWM solenoid valve is also presented. Simulated results using the established models are compared with the experimental results for both the static characteristics of a PWM solenoid valve and the dynamic behavior of a system composed of a PWM solenoid valve and a constant volume chamber.",

@Article{ adaptive_pneumatic,

Pneumatic actuators are of particular interest for robotic applications because of their large force output per unit weight, and their low cost. Stabilization of a pneumatic actuator is difficult if a high bandwidth closed-loop system is desired. This is because of the compressibility of air, and of the nonlinear characteristics of air flowing through a variable area orifices. Further complications arise from the geometry of the mechanism because the equations of motion are highly nonlinear. The order of the dominant dynamics is shown to vary with the position of the mechanism.",
