\input{goals_and_requirements/goals_and_requirements_transmission.tex}

\section{Intake}

The goal of the intake subsystem is to implement an electronic controller for a variable-length (2-stage intake) intake plenum that will be actuated with a light-weight RC servomotor.

The controller must be able to react to changes in engine RPM, and select the best runner length for that RPM range.

Engine RPM ramp-rates under expected loading conditions were estimated with the engine on a dynamometer by the Formula SAE engine team. They have given us a timing requirement that the controller and actuator must be able to switch runner length configurations in approximately \unit{150}{\milli\second}.

The intake controller designed must be able to receive RPM data from the ECU over CANBus, and should be able to control an RC-Servomotor.

\section{Starter}

The goal of the starter subsystem is to ease control of the engine starting operation on the driver.

The starter subsystem will implement a dual-mode starting sequence, including manual and one-touch.

\section{Braking}


\subsection{Bias Adjustment}

Eliminate manual adjustment by implementing an electronic adjustment
capability. 

Actuate a 4-wire stepper motor attached to the brake pedal assembly.

Be able to actuate bias from the cockpit electronically from 30/70
to 70/30 by steps of 1/2\% in less than one second while vehicle in
motion.

Lock out bias adjustment while braking.


\subsection{Calibration}

Must provide ability to recalibrate adjustment systems to adjust for
mechanical wear and inconsistency. Calibration routines should take
no longer than 30 seconds.

\section{Driver Interface}


\subsection{Driver Controls}

Provide a means of shifting gears with minimum driver effort. (No
manual timing or clutching)

Provide a means of actuating all the features of the transmission
system (....)


\subsection{Vehicle Dynamic Adjustment}

Provide an easy to use interface to adjust vehicle dynamic parameters.

Allow driver to choose between sets of dynamic vehicle parameters
or `operating modes'.

Adjustment should be made by a single knob to reduce driver effort
required.

Adjustment of any vehicle parameters is verboten above 25 km/h.

Tuning of individual dynamic parameters and permanent changing of
preset modes should be capable through the driver interface itself.


\subsection{Diagnostic Information}

Critical warnings, such as engine overheating, low oil pressure, low battery, and other subsystem errors should be displayed to the user in a manner that will attract their attention.

Supplimentary vehicle performance information should be available to the driver (engine RPM, fuel, oil pressure, battery voltage, etc.) without being a distraction.


\subsection{Visually Appealing Interface}

Display startup logo.

Display easy-to-read fonts.

Interface should never be a distraction to the driver.

Visible in full light as well as low light.

Visible through sun visor helmet.

Minimize wiring, noise resiliance, maximise interconnectivity
