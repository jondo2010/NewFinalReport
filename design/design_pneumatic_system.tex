\section{Pneumatic System}

\subsection{Purpose}

Actuation of the clutch and gear selection levers. 

Be controlled electronically by the transmission control module.

After deciding to not change away from pneumatics, an improved actuation scheme was proposed that would both improve the controllability and efficiency of the system. A diagram of the mechanical portion of the pneumatics system can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:pneumatics_design}.

\subsubsection{Air tank}

An on-board compressed air tank 

\subsubsection{Regulator}

The air tank is fitted with a pressure regulator, which regulates the system pressure to approximately $120\,psi$. 

\subsubsection{Valves}

4 electronically controlled pneumatic valves control the flow of air to and from 2 pneumatic actuators.

\subsection{Valving Design}

Reduces air consumption

Increases controllability


\subsection{Modelling}

Entire system modelled in Simulink
