 \section{Engine}

The main goal of the engine system is to optimize the peak torque output of engine. This can be accomplished with a variable-length intake system, as suggested by Groening in \cite{LucasIntake}. Achieving this requires the ability to monitor the current engine speed and to mechanically adjust the runner lengths as needed.

\begin{itemize}
\item Automatically adjust the variable-length two-position intake to optimize peak torque output.
\item The intake runner length should be chosen automatically by determining the best position to optimize output power.
\item Changing the intake runner length positions should take no more than \unit{150}{\milli\second}.
\end{itemize}
